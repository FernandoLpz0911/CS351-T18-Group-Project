# Tech Stacks

**Q6:** Which tech stacks will your group use (Django + React or Flask + React)? 
*The tech stack our group will use is: Django + React*

# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:**
*Generative AI committing copyright infringement on artists works.*

**Solution 1:** 
*Program that stores the artists images from the frontend, processed via django, and stored into SQL database with if they are fine with ai use or not, datetime created, and a SHA Key Fingerprint that's specific to the IP of the artist. Should also allow for viewing of images and their specific SHA Key Fingerprint Data. Kind of like Google Play Store developer SHA Key's but for Artist Works. Should contain the key even if scraped by AI and used elsewhere.*

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**

**Solution 2:** 

**Problem 3:**
*Students struggle to find available and suitable study spaces on campus. They waste time walking between libraries and buildings only to find all spots taken, or they find a space that doesn't fit their needs (e.g., a noisy area, no power outlets, etc.).*

**Solution 3:**
*A real-time study spot map web app that shows the current occupancy and amenities of campus study areas. Students can filter by location, noise level, group size, and availability of power outlets. The app utilizes crowd-sourced reports from students to update a space's "busyness" and environment, enabling everyone to find the ideal place to study.*

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**

**Implementation 4:**

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**

**Implementation 5:**


# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

# Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**
*We decided on using SQLite since it's a language we have begun to be familiarized through CS 341 and is a dedicated database which we can manage fully.*

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**
*It will directly be storing the images and their related image data. It's directly supporting the application in its process of storing and verifying IP of copyrighted works.*

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**
*We'll need to use a Cryptographic Hashing library (hashlib) to hash the image with the unique id specific to the artist. We will also need hexdigest() which can convert the hash into a hexadecimal string we can read, literally for converting backwards. We will also need the stegano library to embed the key into the images and to be able to extract it.*

**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**

There's no limitations since it's local only.

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**
